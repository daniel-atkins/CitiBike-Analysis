# CitiBike-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to make this argument, we take a look at ride numbers, ride times, rides by gender, ride locations, and rides by day per hour.

## Summary
This data demonstrates that this bike-sharing program is a good business decision, assuming it can be competently marketed to men who are willing to use it for their commute.

Further analysis could include two more pieces of information:

  1). An analysis done on cost & revenue
  
  2). An analysis done on age (ie. can CitiBike be marketed to teenagers, or just adults who are commuting to work?)
